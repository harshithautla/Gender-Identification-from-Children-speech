# Gender-Identification-from-Children-speech
It identifies the gender of the children from their speech.
Gender identification from speech is an important aspect with many
applications including speaker identification, speaker segmentation, and
personalizing human-machine interactions,for normalization of speech features, which has been shown to decrease word
error rate in speech recognition. Gender identification can improve the
prediction of other speaker traits such as age and emotion, either by jointly
modeling gender with age (or emotion) or in a pipelined manner. Speaker
verification systems also implicitly or explicitly use gender information.
